# User Guide

Once you have familiarized yourself with the OMOP CDM and the ECLS CDM
data structure, it's time to start mapping your data.

!!! info

    Since the OMOP CDM and its expansions are not used as the live database
    backend of digital EHR systems, mapping processes are necessary to
    convert any existing or new data to the data model.

    However, we hope we will be able to provide a user interface to help
    enter ECLS-related data in the future that is integrateable into
    existing hospital information systems.

This user guide should help you to explore typical mapping use cases for
ECLS.

### How do I collect patient data not specific to ECLS?

Standard patient data will find its place in the standard OMOP CDM tables.
Please refer to the manual of the OMOP CDM for further details:
