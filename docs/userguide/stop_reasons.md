# When the ECLS is stopped...

There are several reasons why ECLS might be stopped. They involve
change in patient status, disease progression, resource limitations and
adherence to local protocols, patient or family wishes or sometimes
complications with the ECLS circuit and/or its components.

Collecting these data is essential for improving patient outcomes,
guiding clinical practice, and refining protocols, ultimately leading
to more efficient, safer and targeted treatment approaches.

**Stop reasons** are collected for each **core table**.
Depending on the core table, additional concepts specific to this
table are available. Stop reasons are collected using the
_.stop_reason_concept_id_ column of each respective table.

## ...without complications

When an ECLS run is stopped and none of the circuit components or the
circuit itself were replaced, each corresponding database entry (run,
circuit, components) should have the same _.stop_reason_concept_id_.

## ...with complications

Complications on a circuit or component level might lead to an exchange
of the faulty component as well as other parts of the circuit. Each
affected component should have the same _.stop_reason_concept_id_.

## General stop reasons

If no complication occurs, you can choose one of the following stop reasons
to end your run for your respective database entries (run,
circuit, components).

!!! info "Death"

    If the patient dies, a respective entry in the OMOP CDM _death_ table
    is necessary. Sometimes, ECLS support is withdrawn for a _Moribund_ patient,
    because death is expected. The major difference between _Dead_ and
    _Moribund_ regarding data capture is the timestamp of _death_datetime_.

    The patient dies "on ECLS"<br>
    *Dead*: death.death_datetime = ecls_run.stop_datetime <br>

    The patient is decannulated and dies shortly afterwards<br>
    *Moribund*: death.death_datetime > ecls_run.stop_datetime
