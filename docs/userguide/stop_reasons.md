# When the ECLS is stopped...

There are several reasons why ECLS might be stopped. They involve
change in patient status, disease progression, resource limitations and
adherence to local protocols, patient or family wishes or sometimes
complications with the ECLS circuit and/or its components.

Collecting these data is essential for improving patient outcomes,
guiding clinical practice, and refining protocols, ultimately leading
to more efficient, safer and targeted treatment approaches.

**Stop reasons** are collected for each **core table**.
Depending on the core table, additional concepts specific to this
table are available. Stop reasons are collected using the
*.stop_reason_concept_id* column of each respective table. For
stop reasons that are not complications refer to the structure
documentation.

If a complication is the reason for stopping a circuit and/or component
choose the most specific concept and use it as *.stop_reason_concept_id*
for every component involved.
