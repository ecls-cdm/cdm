# Welcome!

The **Extracorporeal Life Support Common Data Model (ECLS CDM)** is a
**community-driven expansion** for the **Observational Medical Outcomes
Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP CDM)**.

We are in the state of finalizing the official documentation which will
be hosted via GitHub pages. Make sure to visit our repository regularly
to stay updated on the state of the expansion!
